# drum-machine
This is a simple drum machine using PyGame and the tkinter GUI toolkit

To run, save the .py file and the .wav and .png files in the same folder on your computer, open the folder on your terminal/cmd prompt, type "python drum.py" and press ENTER.

When you run this script, it creates a window that has buttons for a hi-hat, kick drum and a snare.
You can play those by either clicking the buttons or by using key bindings.

Key bindings:
S - snare
H - hi-hat
K - kick drum
